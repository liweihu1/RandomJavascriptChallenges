# RandomJavascriptChallenges
Just as the title says

Since I'm not really programming during my minor for school.
I took the opportunity to just do some basic challenges and try and learn to perfect my javascript skills.
But then again, there's a new framework popping up like every other day so I don't know how usefull it'll be :p
